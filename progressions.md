## L-Sit Progression
Adapted from [Reddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/bodyweightfitness/wiki/exercises/l-sit/).

The goal for each progression step is to build up to a continuous hold for 30-60 (no pause). The recommendations range from 30 to 60s for different coaches and will probably vary for each athlete. Start with 60 seconds. If you notice a plateau (no progress for 2+ sessons, accounting for possible "fucked days", breaks etc.) above 30s, try the next progression step. If you can hold it for > 10 seconds, you can continue with that step.

As long as you can't reach the 60 seconds, use multiple sets to get a cumulative time of 60 seconds, for example:
- 12 x 5s
- 6 x 10s
- 15s + 15s + 10s + 10s + 10s
- 3 x 20s
- 2 x 30s
- 1 x 60s

**Very imporant: learn to breathe under tension, otherwise 60s are impossible.**
Each set should be max. 80% to failure, e.g. if you can do 10 seconds, do 8 for multiple sets.

Please not that the next progression step will be unlocked a lot earlier than you can hold the previous one for 60s, but you won't be able to hold it for long. This is ok, feel free to explore more difficult steps even if you didn't "finish" the previous step yet, but the main work sets should be the current step to stay in the correct intensity range.
It is useful to warm up with the progression steps until you reach the "current" step.
If you feel good after the 60s, the rep based progression of the hanging L-Sit can be added (Prio 2, optional). The total time should not exeed 10 minutes.

2. Two-Foot supported L-Sit [Progression Sequence YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IUZJoSP66HI)
3. One-Foot supported L-Sit
    - Variant: alternating legs
4. Highly elevated tuck L-Sit
    - slowly extend tuck to make it more difficult
5. Parallelette tuck L-Sit
6. Floor tuck L-sit
7. Parallelette L-Sit
8. Floor L-Sit

#### Progression steps for hanging L-Sit (bar, rings):
##### Rep based progression
Work up to 3x12 reps before progressing.
The degrees refer to the angle between the torso and the upper leg.
1. Knee raises to 120°
1. Knee raises to 120° with pause
1. Leg raises to 120°
1. Leg raises to 120° with pause
1. Knee raises to 90°
2. Knee raises to 90° with pause
1. Leg raises to 90°
2. Leg raises to 90° with pause
3. Knee raises to 60° 
4. Knee raises to 60° with pause 
3. Leg raises to 60° 
4. Leg raises to 60° with pause
5. "Knees to Elbows"
6. "Toes to Bar"
    - Diagonal variants are possible
7. "Knees to Elbows" with pause
7. "Toes to Bar" with pause
    - "Windshield wipers"

##### Isometric progression
Use this when the respective raises with pause are achieved. The 120° variant is not necessary, better to use the rep based progression to get to 90° first. It's possible that the 90° variant is easier than the 
1. 90° Tuck L-Sit
1. 90° Extended Tuck L-Sit
2. 60° Tuck L-Sit
1. 90° L-Sit
2. 60° Extended Tuck L-Sit
2. 60° L-Sit
3. V-Sit (30° L-Sit?)
