# Dynamic Effort
[Westside Barbell Summary](https://www.westside-barbell.com/blogs/the-blog/starting-conjugate-dynamic-effort)
- core idea: F=ma - maximize acceleration a at lower weight m to produce similar F as 1RM, but with less fatique
- intent to move as fast as possible with a load that is sufficient, but not too heavy
- plan each lift separately, program in waves of ca. 3 weeks
- 8-12 sets
- Louie Simmonâ€™s: 3 reps bench, 2 reps squats, 1 rep deadlift per set
- 30% - 70% intensity, depends on the lifter (need to try out). Upper body typically lower % than lower body
- consider bands, specialty bars, chains
