# Powerlifting Concepts
## Westside Conjugate Method
Alternative approach to periodization. Keep intensity and volume high all the time, but vary movements.

Split into Maximum Effort Days and Dynamic Effort Days:
- Monday Squat/Deadlift Max Effort
- Wednesday Bench Max Effort
- Friday Squat/Deadlift Dynamic Effort
- Saturday Bench Dynamic Effort
The days are like this so that it is not necessary to adjust for meets - just keep training and taper off.

Pick main lift + 3 variations. Rotate them every week for a 4 week mesocycle (main lift + 3 variants). Try to max out on max effort days. 

Focus on equipped + untested lifters regarding exercise selection. Use a lot of partial ROM, probably because of equipment.
Variations are selected to focus on weaknesses, for example good mornings if you fold forward in a squat. Deadlifts are considered a squat variation.

Uses sled pushes, drags etc. for general physical preparedness. Only used when lifters can't get through the volume.

## Dynamic Effort
[Westside Barbell Summary](https://www.westside-barbell.com/blogs/the-blog/starting-conjugate-dynamic-effort)
- core idea: F=ma - maximize acceleration a at lower weight m to produce similar F as 1RM, but with less fatique
- intent to move as fast as possible with a load that is sufficient, but not too heavy
- plan each lift separately, program in waves of ca. 3 weeks
- 8-12 sets
- Louie Simmonâ€™s: 3 reps bench, 2 reps squats, 1 rep deadlift per set
- 30% - 70% intensity, depends on the lifter (need to try out). Upper body typically lower % than lower body
- consider bands, specialty bars, chains


# Own Ideas
## YT Intensity Scale (YTS)
Reps in reserve (RIR) and rate of percieved exertion (RPE) are hard to estimate. RPE is poorly defined and often operationalized as 10-RIR.
RIR are are hard to estimate on the "easy side", e.g. RIR > 2. Did you really only have 3 reps in reserve or could you have gotten 4? or 5?
Also, both scales are not well defined on the heavy end. Within the range from 0 to 1 RIR, there are very relevant distinctions - was that set to actual failure?
Did you barely grind out the last rep? Did you make a solid single that would have gotten 3 white lights in a meet, but clearly didn't have another one in reserve? All these are RIR 0.
Therefore, this scale is an attempt at adressing these shortcomings with a scale that focuses on the top end.:

YTS:
1. Rehab work
2. Warm Up Sets
3. Easy set, 2-3 reps in reserve.
4. Solid last rep, another solid rep in reserve. If not sure if it is, use 5.
5. Final rep was heavy, but solid. No reps in reserve.
6. Ground out the rep with the last desparate effort. Almost failed.
7. Set to actual failure giving all out effort (no early quitting allowed)

## Non-Interference Combinations
To reduce total training time, it makes sense to alternate sets of 2+ different movements.
Typically, these are based on antagonists, but they tend to interfere (e.g. Pull Ups and OHP).
Therefore, it is better to consider "superset interference" directly and not via proxy metric.
From experience, these combinations of the main lifts work well together:
1. Squats and Pull Ups - the lat activation of the pull up even helps to get upper back tightness during Squats
2. Bench and Rows - this is a classic
3. Deadlift and OHP - especially OHP from rack/blocks

## Main vs. Volume lifts, Acessories
In principle, I consider Squat (Squat), Bench (Horizontal Press), Deadlift (Hinge) equally important to Overhead Press (Vertical Press), Pull Ups (Vertical Pull) and Rows (Horizontal Pull).
However, SBD responds well to high intensity training, while OHP/PU/Rows respond better to volume.
Therefore it makes sense to divide them into two groups for program building: 3 main lifts + 3 volume lifts

Regarding accessories, there is a large number of possible things to do. However, some key areas are useful
1. Adressing Weak Points: Abs, Biceps, Grip - these are partially trained with the 3 main&volume lifts, but additional work helps.
2. Pre-Hab style work: Back, Shoulders/Chest, Hips - these tend to get thight and require some additional light work to get moving again
    Back: Reverse Hyper, Decompression
    Hips: Deep Squat Position, Lunges, Cossack Squats
    Shoulders/Chest: Dead Hangs, Rotations, Raises
3. Skill work for life quality like handstand, balance, isometric holds (levers), flips - mainly fun driven, but also work well as General Physical Preparedness


## Movement Domain Tetrahedron
Reps - Holds - Complexes - Locomotion

- Reps - typical strength training, like a set of 5 squats
- Holds - isometric holds, e.g. plank or dead hang for grip
- Complexes/Combos - complex movements with many elements, e.g. Weightlifting complexes
- Locomotion - moving exercises e.g. Farmer's Walk, most of parkour

Not all sports involve all domains. Specifically, Powerlifting and Weightlifting are extremely one-sided. One should consider exploring the other domains for health & gains.

Powerlifting | 5 | 1 | 1 | 1

Crossfit | 4 | 2 | 4 | 3
Calisthenics | 3 | 5 | 2 | 1
Parkour | 2 | 2 | 5 | 5 |
Cardio | 2 | 1 | 1 | 5
Bodybuilding | 5 | 2 | 1 | 1
Movement Culture | 2 | 3 | 5 | 5
Climbing | 1 | 4 | 4 | 3

## Attribute Tetrahedron
STRength - SPeeD - DEXterity - CONstitution

STR - maximum force output, e.g. 1 rep max squat
SPD - rate of force development, e.g. throwing, sprinting, jumping
DEX - ability to precisely control the body, e.g. evading strikes in MMA or rail precisions in Parkour
CON - work capacity in aerobic and anaerobic domain. e.g. 10 rep squat and 30 minute run. Might be useful to differentiate it further in aerobic and anaerobic? However, it is probably highly correlated.

Similar to the movement domains, different sport have different focus. It might make sense to deal with excessive weaknesses.
Training plans can be strucured well by focusing on a specific attribute within a training block.
However, the attributes differ by their recovery demand. SPD exhaustion feels different than STR or CON. However, DEX is probably the attribute with least recovery demand.
The balance of recovery should be considered when using multi-attribute training by not trying to do everything all at once.

Sport | STR | CON | SPD | DEX | Variety
