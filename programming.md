# Special Plans
## 2022-10 Powerlifting meet preparation
Plan was made 7 weeks out from a base of high volume, low frequency (10 day microcycle, 3 sessions per week).
Goal was to hit a 600 total in the PL meet

Goals
Squat    - 190-205-215
      alt. 200-215-225 if training goes really well
Bench    - 140-150-157.5
Deadlift - 200-225-235 if I have a bad day and assuming 215-150=365 sub total
           220-235-242.5 if I have a decent day and assuming 215-150=365
           220-235-250 if 235 feels really easy

### Result
Around Week 3 my wrist/thumb of the left hand started hurting a lot. This meant I basically skipped 1 week of training. In week 6, I got corona and canceled the final meet preparation.
Other than that, it feld like the prep is going well. Specifically the adapted dynamic effort days were fun, easy on recovery and good for practicing technique. The technique days in the final weeks were probably too much.
I should try again sometime with the speed reps. I think I need more volume in the main lifts.

## 2022-12 Post-Corona Infection Recovery Plan
Idea was to start out slow, then increase pace and volume. Add more exercise variety then in the final phases of the meet prep, start getting back into WL.
In practice I did whatever I wanted to. Had some heavy sessions and some light ones. Achieved 4 per Week training frequency again, but did not do much Parkour.

## 2023 Plan - Sport-Block Periodization
    "Don't major in the minors"
    "Don't do everything all at once"
Play around with increasing volume in the major lifts and moving from bullshit assistance to compound assistance, e.g. triceps extensions to dips.

Reduced Assistance selection:
- Push: Dips, DB OHP, DB Bench
- Pull: Pullups, 1 Arm DB Rows, 1 Arm Seated Cable Rows
- Rest: Abs, Curls, Grip, Handstand
- Metcon: Alsruhe-Sets

I noticed that:
- Biceps opener is a really nice way to get curls done with increased ROM
- Concept 2 Rower is a great warmup

General Layout: Train on Mo, Di, Do, Fr. Add Pk on Sundays.
A: 4+4 WL, S, Push, Grip
A: 4+4 WL, B, Pull, Curls
A: 4+4 WL, D, Push, Handstand
A: 4+4 WL, O, Pull, Abs
or something like that - actually this is stupid. Let's do it differently.
Need to expand the plan with more specific weights and rep ranges. Specifically, try to push the volume of the main lifts further.


## 2023-04-01 Post-China Weightlifting Competition Preparation
Competition was on 2023-04-22, so I had 3 weeks to prepare from a fully recovered state.

Review:
Peaked in Week 2 already, pushed it too hard it seems.
Competition went ok, but could be better if I timed the peaking more precisely.
Could have taken more time for technique work before going heavy. Overall load was good, I was pretty exhaused by the end of it, but still fit enough for the competition.

## 2023-04-22 - 2023-05-24
Chaos training, was too lazy to write a new plan. Check logs for details.

## 2023-05-25 7-Week Plan before Summer Vacation
- Focus on Powerlifting instead of weightlifting
- Ease into skill work and start building aerobic capacity

End of Year Goals:
- set all time bench PR (only one left since broken arm)
- Drop bodyweight to <100kg
- regain mobility and stability in hips and especially shoulders
    - should be noticeable in hanging movements
- Regain Skills:
    - parkour - establish regular (1+ times a week) routine
    - hold free standing handstand for >10s
    - re-learn free standing backflip
- explore:
    - Crossfit/MetCons/Cardio - for long term health
        - actual goal is aerobic capacity and strength endurance
    - Calisthenics - for fun and entertainment

### Key setup
4 Day Split based on non-interference combos
1. Squat + Pull Ups + MetCon
2. Bench + Rows + MetCon
3. Deadlift + OHP + MetCon
4. Assistance Day
8 sets for main lifts + volume lifts to reach minimum adaptation stress
Cluster assistance on a separate day to focus on the main lifts. Add metcons or skill work instead.
Use lift variants wisely.

Classic Block Periodization: 3 Weeks volume, 2 weeks transformation, 2 weeks realisation

Weekly schedule:
KdK - KdK - Parkour? - KdK - KdK - Sabbat - Parkour
