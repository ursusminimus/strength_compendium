# 2024 Training Plan V1
- Plan written on 2024-12-18. 
- Status: never executed

First training plan based on the modular training system. Unfortuantely, a weird shoulder injury prevented execution. Start after X-Mas.

#### Observations 2024-12-18
- Modular Training System is the way
- Lower volume for PL is fine
- WL hurts my bones - need to warm up properly
- stretching with Thea is super useful
- running with Loki is surprisingly fun and clearly a win-win. Use HR as intensity meter

#### Block periodization:
1. January - Easter: Strength Season with Condition as secondary focus. Parkour, mobility on maintenance
2. Easter - Summer Vacation: Dexterity Season with Condition as secondary focus
3. Fall/Winter: specify Seasons 3 and 4 in Summer

#### Weekly schedules:
| Season | Mon | Tue | Wed | Thu | Fri | Sat | Sun |
|--------|-----|-----|-----|-----|-----|-----|-----|
| 1. STR | PL  | PL  | Run | PL  | W*  | PL  | Pk  |
| 2. DEX | Run | PL  | Pk  | PL  | W*  | GPP | Pk  |
- W* Wildcard - do whatever is fun
- GPP General Physical Preparedness - non-specific strength and conditioning - do whatever is fun

# 2024 Shoulder Injury Revocery Plan
- Plan written on 2024-02-19.
- Status: success

#### Core ideas
- Focus on the mai lifts (SBDO-RP).
- Regain F_max
- low volume, high frequency
- Work up to a single at RPE9, then 3 back-off sets at RPE7-8.
- abs and grip are only accessories

#### Rep Ranges:
- S: 3R
- B: 5R
- D: 3R
- O: 8R
- R: 8R
- P: 2 sets bodyweight, 1 set weighted

#### Plan
Alternating A/B sessions:
1. B D R Abs
2. S O P Grip

In summary, this worked quite well to get me back on track in a very short time before skiing vacation.

# 2024 Training Plan V2
## Introduction
Initial situation:
- prepared a plan for 2024, but couldn't execute because my shoulder was fucked up
- procrastinated on a new plan due to vacation etc.
- kind of bored with previous plan
- want to be more athletic and generally awesome rather than 5% stronger

In conclusion: focus on fun & health instead of sport specialisation.

More specifically:

Fun:
- I enjoy Parkour much more than Powerlifting & Weightlifiting
- I enjoy expanding my skillset (e.g. L-Sit, Handstand, ...) and learning new things

Health:
- Cardio health is important - running with the dog is a win-win
- Joint health is also important
    - Weightlifting is an issue - need to deal with it carefully
    - Parkour is not trivial either
- I notice that neglecting mobility work is a problem. Stretching with 7vsWild was very beneficial.

Implications:
- make basic strength maintenance plan that is easy to recover from so that it doesn't fuck up the other things
- make sure I actually go to Parkour training
- add running as training units
- add weightlifting very carefully to avoid damage (clean and jerk seems much worse than snatch)
    - focused blocks to 
- vary details over the year

## Goals
- Powerlifting:
    - maintain strength over the year (90%+), approach ca. 600kg total in strength cycle at the end of the year
    - fix deadlift technique - I am tired of this shit
    - favor 100kg overhead press instead of pushing bench
- Weightlifting: 
    - try to finally get 3rd extension right
    - snatch PR
- Supertotal comp with Hung at year end
- Strongman:
    - see if we can expand the capabilities in VfV

## Macrocycles ("Season")
This part is better done with a calendar.

#### Spring Season (Q2)
- Start Easter 2024-04-01
- End Summer vacation in July
- Fokus: Skill and Cardio

#### Summer Season (Q3)
- Start Summer vacation in July
- End Fall vacation, maybe 2024-10-03 (T.d.D.Einheit)
- Fokus: Skill and Cardio
- Only separated from Q2 due to vacation - good time to review mikro&mesocycles

#### Fall Season (Q4)
- Start Fall Vacation
- End X-Mas
- Fokus: Strength

Notation: SQ1, SQ2, SQ3, SQ4.

## Mesocycles ("Block")


SQ2: plan forward from today
- CW13 - intro week
- SQ2B1: CW14-18 load, CW19 deload
- SQ2B2: CW20-24 load, CW25 deload
- depending on when our vacation is exactly: add something here

SQ3: plan based on vacations
- fill gap between summer and fall vacations

SQ4:
- SQ4B1: adjust based on fall vacation CW40-44 load? CW45 deload? TddEinheit is CW40
- SQ4B2: CW46-50 load, CW51 taper
- CW52: Maxout
