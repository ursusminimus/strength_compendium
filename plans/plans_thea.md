# 2023-10 - Epic Quest for the ABSolutely Unbreakable Galactic Core of Metal...Core
Based on the modular training system (TODO link).

## Overview
The program expects 3 training sessions per week: A, B, C.

Each session follows a modular structure:
1. Warm Up - Prio 1
2. Skill Work - Prio 1
3. Strength Work - Prio 2
4. Assistance Exercises - Prio 3
5. Mobility Work - Prio 2

The progression between sessions is described for each module separately.

## Warm Up
- 3 minute Row Ergometer
    - resistance level 4
    - should feel warm afterwards, if not, increase to 4-5 minutes
- Mobilize/Warm Up tight areas, depending on what is tight.
    - Make sure hips are not tight
    - On Handstand days: Shoulders and Wrists need special attention
    - Try out controlled articulate rotations (CARs) with low-medium intensity.

- Activate (make sure they work):
    - Lats (Active/Passive hangs) - one easy set RPE 6
    - Abs with short Hollow Hold, Plank, ... - one easy set RPE 6
    - Low Back with (Reverse-) Hyperextension - one easy set RPE 6

## Skill Work
One of the [progressions](progressions.md).
- L-Sit
- Handstand

TODO discuss Can be split by A, B, C or focused on one skill for longer periods depending on personal preferences.

## Strength Work
#### Session A:
Alternating Sets:
1. Legs - Walking Lunges or Bulgarian Split Squats with Kettlebells
    - Possible to alternate Walking Lunges and Split Squats each week

    - Split squats as base exercise and bodyweight walking lunges as assistance?
        - 3 sets of 8-12 reps base
        - 2 additional sets of different exercise (increase to 3 later) PRIO 3
2. Pull Ups
    - Lat Pull Down (no passive hang) - 5 sets, 8-12 reps
        - TODO write down specific weights for progression: 35kg starting weight
    - TODO discuss how to program progression of regular pullup

#### Session B:
1. Overhead Press
