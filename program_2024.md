# 2024 Training Plan
## Introduction
Initial situation:
- prepared a plan for 2024, but couldn't execute because my shoulder was fucked up
- procrastinated on a new plan due to vacation etc.
- kind of bored with previous plan
- want to be more athletic and generally awesome rather than 5% stronger

In conclusion: focus on fun & health instead of sport specialisation.

More specifically:

Fun:
- I enjoy Parkour much more than Powerlifting & Weightlifiting
- I enjoy expanding my skillset (e.g. L-Sit, Handstand, ...) and learning new things

Health:
- Cardio health is important - running with the dog is a win-win
- Joint health is also important
    - Weightlifting is an issue - need to deal with it carefully
    - Parkour is not trivial either
- I notice that neglecting mobility work is a problem. Stretching with 7vsWild was very beneficial.

Implications:
- make basic strength maintenance plan that is easy to recover from so that it doesn't fuck up the other things
- make sure I actually go to Parkour training
- add running as training units
- add weightlifting very carefully to avoid damage (clean and jerk seems much worse than snatch)
    - focused blocks to 
- vary details over the year

## Goals
- Powerlifting:
    - maintain strength over the year (90%+), approach ca. 600kg total in strength cycle at the end of the year
    - fix deadlift technique - I am tired of this shit
    - favor 100kg overhead press instead of pushing bench
- Weightlifting: 
    - try to finally get 3rd extension right
    - snatch PR
- Supertotal comp with Hung at year end
- Strongman:
    - see if we can expand the capabilities in VfV

## Macrocycles ("Season")
General idea is to divide the year in 4 seasons, each roughly 3 months (13 weeks).
The boundaries are typically defined by sport events, such as competition, offseason vs. plays, etc.
Since I am not an athlete, my blocks are more easily defined by interruptions: vacations, business trips, etc.. Obvious vacations are: Christmas, Easter, Summer, Fall.
Training can be adapted for the specific vacation - it is a big difference what the vacation is.

#### Spring Season (Q2)
- Start Easter 2024-04-01
- End Summer vacation in July
- Fokus: Skill and Cardio

#### Summer Season (Q3)
- Start Summer vacation in July
- End Fall vacation, maybe 2024-10-03 (T.d.D.Einheit)
- Fokus: Skill and Cardio
- Only separated from Q2 due to vacation - good time to review mikro&mesocycles

#### Fall Season (Q4)
- Start Fall Vacation
- End X-Mas
- Fokus: Strength

Notation: SQ1, SQ2, SQ3, SQ4.

## Mesocycles ("Block")
Based on previous experience, I need deloads around every 6th week.
For a long time I tried 531's 3+1 week deload, which was too frequent.
Then, I tried running 2 531 blocks back to back, which also didn't work, because I usually broke down in week 5 or so. Therefore:

6 weeks blocks: 5 load + 1 deload

This means each season is roughly 2 blocks. To adjust for flexible schedules, additional shorter blocks can be added.

SQ2: plan forward from today
- CW13 - intro week
- SQ2B1: CW14-18 load, CW19 deload
- SQ2B2: CW20-24 load, CW25 deload
- depending on when our vacation is exactly: add something here

SQ3: plan based on vacations
- fill gap between summer and fall vacations

SQ4:
- SQ4B1: adjust based on fall vacation CW40-44 load? CW45 deload? TddEinheit is CW40
- SQ4B2: CW46-50 load, CW51 taper
- CW52: Maxout
